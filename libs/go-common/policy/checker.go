// Package policy is the OSS hook point for plan-gated features and usage
// limits. It is neutral — no cloud-specific code lives here. Self-hosted
// deployments use NoopChecker (allow everything). DecisionBox Cloud
// registers a CloudChecker via init() in the cloud tenant image that
// calls the control plane at runtime.
//
// Handlers call policy.GetChecker() at every chokepoint:
//
//	ck := policy.GetChecker()
//	res, err := ck.CheckCreateProject(ctx, deploymentID, intent)
//	if err != nil { /* translate PolicyError → HTTP 402/403 */ }
//	defer ck.Release(ctx, res.ID) // released on error; superseded by caller on success
//
// The interface is future-ready for enforced LLM token caps — the
// ObserveLLMTokens call today is observe-only, but upgrading to an
// enforced reserve/confirm pair later requires only a cap field on
// PlanLimits and flipping the endpoint. The wire shape is identical.

// deployment concept in OSS) and should pass "". The cloud plugin
// substitutes its configured DEPLOYMENT_ID env var in that case.
